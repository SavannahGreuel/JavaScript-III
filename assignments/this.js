/* The for principles of "this";
* in your own words. explain the four principle for the "this" keyword below.
*
* 1. When you use this in the global scope, the "this" value will be the window. It will pull up alot of things you dont want it to pull up.
* 2. Implicit binding is used when dot notation is used to invoke a function. whatever is left of the dot is it's context 
* 3. New binding is  used when a constructor function is used. 
* 4. Explicit binding is when call or apply explicitly defines this
*
* write out a code example of each explanation above
